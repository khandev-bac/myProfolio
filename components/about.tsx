          I'm a backend-focused engineer who enjoys designing APIs, data models, and scalable services. I prioritize correctness and simplicity from day one. While my passion lies in backend development, Iâ€™ve also tinkered with Flutter, React Native, and Python for generative AI to prototype end-to-end experiences when needed
